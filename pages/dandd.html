 <h4>Logo Design</h4>
 <img src="../assets/IMG_5466.PNG" alt="Explorations of logo identity" style="max-width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;">
 <p>I initally began the process of designing a logo by brainstorming. Seen above are rough sketches of different variations of logos.
    I knew that I wanted a hand to be featured in the logo but in a manner that was creative and reflected the style guide.
    For the second iteration of the app, I was inclined towards a hand in a peace sign or 'y' pose and filling in the rest of 
    the square icon space with shapes to construct a type of South African flag. This, upon inspection and testing seemed to be confusing as the 
    South African flag does not use the colour palette primarily and therefore this design was abandoned. 
    I realized for recognition, a simple hand with an added feature would be the best approach in order to create brand identity.
    For this reason, I chose a hand speech bubble logo.
 </p>

 <h5>Final Logo Process</h5>
 <img src="../assets/designhands.png" alt="" style="max-width: 90%; margin-left: 22%;">
 <img src="../assets/logo.png" alt="" style="max-width: 90%; margin-left: 20%;">
 <p>For the logo, I knew that I wanted to include elements that looked hand drawn. There has been a recent spike in what is known as <em>corporate tech art</em>, which 
tends to make use of rounded flat shaded vector drawings. These seemed a bit lifeless to me and banal. Based on my feedback, users would like an app that makes 
learning fun and playful. I have ensured that elements still look polished by creating a logo that is flat shaded and minimally designed, yet I have added 
simple line art using a pencil brush to establish texture and convey a sense of naivity. The pencil marks also hold important utility: they solidifty that the shape is of a hand by adding detail.
This creates a balanced brand identity that can both be trustworthy and professional while 
allowing space for play and fun. Here I have explored the logo variations in size and colour to ensure consistent branding. The simplicity of the logo lends itself to toggle between the primary colours of the product. </p>
 <h4>Character Design</h4>

 <h4>Sign Design</h4>
 <img src="../assets/IMG_5518.JPG" alt="Poster of hand illustrated alphabet" style="max-width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; padding: none;">
 <p>The illustration of the signing content across Hands Up! was created using Procreate. I had to redrawn my original Adobe Illustrator black and white illustrations 
    as they were extremely flat and lifeless. In this iteration of illustrations, I used to primary design guide colours and added pencil draw lines for more information. These illustrations are therefore aesthetically
    aligned with the logo design.
 </p>
<video src="../assets/Untitled_Artwork.MP4" style="max-width: 40%; margin-left: 30%;" autoplay loop muted></video>
 <p>In order to convey the movement attached to signing, I have created 2D animations for phrases and letters that are not static signs.</p>

 <h4>Font creation</h4>
 <p>I decided to add a translation feature. This required a custom font. I had no prior experience creating a custom font so this was a huge learning opportunity. 
    In order to create a font, a vector or bitmap is required rather than a raster image. This proved difficult as I have remedial skills in regard to the pen tool in illustrator. 
    I used my original pngs created in procreate as a reference to recreate them in Illustrator. This redraw process which took up a lot of time could have been avoided, had I originally
    used Illustrator for all images. Despite this, I have created a font that can be easily installed on computers and devices which can be found <a href="">here</a>.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>  I would like to thank a few people who helped make this possible. Thank you to Sage Govender, Kanistha Jadoo-Francis and Gabriel Tidy for consulting me through the process and offering their hands to train some AI.
    Sage is pursuing her Honours in Sign Language and provided indispenable feedback and ensured the readability of the content and correct training of modals. 
    Gabriel encouraged my exploration of Machine Learning and taught me the basics of what computer vision entails. Gabriel has been a wealth of knowledge and support through the project.
    Finally Kanistha for spending hours infront of a web camera posing for teachable machine and giving me feedback on the UX/UI. I would not have been able to create a project to be proud of without the support of my loved ones.
