        <p class="p-summary">Hands Up! aims to create a space for learning South African Sign Language that is interactive and accessible to all ages. 
            The final deliverable for my Digital Arts Project is a proof-of-concept prototype that hints at future functionality. This is the first mobile product that 
            I have ever created.

    <h3 id="user-personas">User Research</h3>
    <p>The user research was conducted by providing a short questionaire to 22 people. I tried to vary the group of people by asking friends 
        who have majored in language during university and deaf potential users. The questions on this survey included: <br/>
    <ol>
        <li> How langauges do you speak?</li>
        <li> Would you consider learning SASL?</li>
        <li> Why do you want to learn SASL if you said yes to the previous question?</li>
        <li> Have you used a language learning application?</li>
        <li> If you have tried to learn sign language, what issues do you face when learning?</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Personas</h4>
    <p>The personas listed below are summarized findings of my user research that encompasses core goals of the potential user base.</p>

    <h5>Natasha</h5>
    <p id="persona-description"> Age: 42, Business Owner, Deaf </p>
    <p>Natasha is partially deaf and has grown up speaking. As she faces this transition to struggle with verbal communication, she would like to learn sign language</p>
</article>
  
<h4>Results </h4>
<p> The persona creation and user research resulted in a few frequent observations. Users would like more interactivity in their learning of sign language. Alot of the 
    availble content consist of video tutorials. For more engaging learning, users would benefit from hands-on learning. Another important insight is that there is a 
    lack of content regarding the learning of South African Sign Language for younger kids. This means that it would be advantageous to create a product that is colourful and 
    fun illustrations. The use of colour is therefore emphasized as bold and interesting colour is enjoyable to younger audiences.

  <hr>
  <h3 id="user-journey">User Journey</h3>
  <img src="../assets/flows.png" alt="user journey map" id="flows" style="align-self: center;">
  <p> A user journey maps out the emotions and actions that drive the user to use the application. This aids in the identification
    of goals and motivations for the user. This summarizes the intended effect of Hands Up!
  </p>
  <h3 id="user-flow">User Flow</h3>
  <img src="../assets/Site Architecture.png" alt="User journey map" id="flows">
<p>This user flow map is helpful in two ways: This aids in the planning of the architecture of the site yet also aids in highlighing important features needed based on user research.
    Since interactivity is a key want of the user, access to quizzez and AI Interactions should be a core feature and therefore easily availble via first pick-up of the app. This user flow also promotes
    basic <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/10-user-interface-guidelines/" target="_blank"> UI Guidelines</a> easy navigation. Benyon (2013) explains that 
    a key factor of enjoyable user experience is ensuring a low cognitive load for the user. This can be excuted by ensuring that key features do not take more that three clicks/touches to naivgate to.
</p>
<h3>Site Architecture</h3>

    <h2>Design Guidelines</h2> <hr>
    <p>The design process that I followed was the Material UI Design system by Google. MUI is widely used, mainly for Android development yet Googles interface is 
        experienced cross-platform and therefore represents a convention of UI design (Clifton 2015, pp22). Since my application is cross-platform I chose to follow this system of guidelines.
    <br> Some key features that have been implemented in the design process are choices of typography, elevation and navigation labelling. </p>
  
    <h3>Style Guide</h3>
    <img src="../assets/Styeguide.png" alt="style guide" style="max-width: 90%; margin-left: 4.5%;">
    <p>When creating my style guide, I ensured that I adhered to core priciples of MUI. In regard to typography, I have chosen to ensure that my enitre site is
        presented in a highly readable and accessible fonts. For this reason, I chose sans-serif fonts. MUI states that expressive fonts should be avoided for important information as these fonts are diffucult to read 
        and clutter the page. <br>
        The colours were chosen with two factors in mind: appeal to a wide age range and contrast. Blue, red and yellow are the primary colours and are therefore 
        a classic palette. While keeping colour theory in mind, blue tends to represent Trustworthiness and Intelligence. Since this is a learning application, these are 
        emotions I would like to be encompassed in Hands Up! Pink was selected because this is a more soft colour that is fun and appealing. The boldness of yellow contrasts greatly against dark blue and also adds a 
        streak of boldness to capture the attention of the user.  I have shifted these values to create my main colour palette. Babich (2020) states that a key concept of using color is balancing the use of colour and suggests breaking
        up a triadic scheme into a main colour, featuring 60% of the space followed by colour 2 for 30% and colour 3 for 10%. I have made blue my main colour as my chosen shade is dark 
        enough to subsitute the use of black. Yellow is the least featured colour despite being a mustard shade because yellow does not contrast well against other colours and therefore can lesson the 
        readability. My secondary colours are derivitive tints of primary colours and red and greens to indicate right and wrong. 
    </p>

 <h3>Illustration</h3>
 <h4>Logo Design</h4>
 <img src="../assets/IMG_5466.PNG" alt="Explorations of logo identity" style="max-width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;">
 <p>I initally began the process of designing a logo by brainstorming. Seen above are rough sketches of different variations of logos.
    I knew that I wanted a hand to be featured in the logo but in a manner that was creative and reflected the style guide.
    For the second iteration of the app, I was inclined towards a hand in a peace sign or 'y' pose and filling in the rest of 
    the square icon space with shapes to construct a type of South African flag. This, upon inspection and testing seemed to be confusing as the 
    South African flag does not use the colour palette primarily and therefore this design was abandoned. 
    I realized for recognition, a simple hand with an added feature would be the best approach in order to create brand identity.
    For this reason, I chose a hand speech bubble logo.
 </p>

 <h5>Final Logo Process</h5>
 <img src="../assets/designhands.png" alt="" style="max-width: 90%; margin-left: 12%;">
 <img src="../assets/logo.png" alt="" style="max-width: 90%; margin-left: 10%;">
 <p>For the logo, I knew that I wanted to include elements that looked hand drawn. There has been a recent spike in what is known as <em>corporate tech art</em>, which 
tends to make use of rounded flat shaded vector drawings. These seemed a bit lifeless to me and banal. Based on my feedback, users would like an app that makes 
learning fun and playful. I have ensured that elements still look polished by creating a logo that is flat shaded and minimally designed, yet I have added 
simple line art using a pencil brush to establish texture and convey a sense of naivity. The pencil marks also hold important utility: they solidifty that the shape is of a hand by adding detail.
This creates a balanced brand identity that can both be trustworthy and professional while 
allowing space for play and fun. Here I have explored the logo variations in size and colour to ensure consistent branding. The simplicity of the logo lends itself to toggle between the primary colours of the product. </p>
 <h4>Character Design</h4>
 <img src="../assets/characters.png" alt="character designs" id="characterDesign">
 <h4>Sign Design</h4>
 <img src="../assets/IMG_5518.JPG" alt="Poster of hand illustrated alphabet" style="max-width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; padding: none;">
 <p>The illustration of the signing content across Hands Up! was created using Procreate. I had to redrawn my original Adobe Illustrator black and white illustrations 
    as they were extremely flat and lifeless. In this iteration of illustrations, I used to primary design guide colours and added pencil draw lines for more information. These illustrations are therefore aesthetically
    aligned with the logo design.
 </p>
<video src="../assets/Untitled_Artwork.MP4" style="max-width: 40%; margin-left: 30%;" autoplay loop muted></video>
 <p>In order to convey the movement attached to signing, I have created 2D animations for phrases and letters that are not static signs.</p>

 <h4>Font creation</h4>
 <p>I decided to add a translation feature. This required a custom font. I had no prior experience creating a custom font so this was a huge learning opportunity. 
    In order to create a font, a vector or bitmap is required rather than a raster image. This proved difficult as I have remedial skills in regard to the pen tool in illustrator. 
    I used my original pngs created in procreate as a reference to recreate them in Illustrator. This redraw process which took up a lot of time could have been avoided, had I originally
    used Illustrator for all images. Despite this, I have created a font that can be easily installed on computers and devices which can be found <a href="">here</a>.

    <h3>Teachable Machine and Tensorflow.js</h3>
    <p> Teachable machine is an in-browser open source software that allows for easy training of models that forgoes the use of python rendering. I chose Teachable Machine because 
        I have not worked with computer vision before. This made training easy as I had to upload images of sign poses and export the model as a Tensorflow file. I trained the model for fingerspelling using over 500 pictures for each letter and using 4 different hands.
        This means that the model is quite small and therefore is glitchy when in use at times. 

    
    </p>
    <p>Tensorflow.js is a platform that supports the creation and training of models and the deployment of these models into production. Tensorflow was originally a python framework yet the creation of the Javascript 
        form helps to deploy models onto the internet quickly. Tensorflow is a lot easier to use in the browser as opposed to a Native Application. Tensorflow and React Native is still in its infancy
    and there is even less support for Expo development. The solution to this was using PyTorch. I created a simple image recognition application using PyTorch and Expo yet there was a major issue: this method required creating and training neural networks using python if I wanted to use my own models.
    As SASL is incredibly low resource, I would have to use my own model and thus I decided that learning python for a simple feature intergration within the time frame for final submission would be unattainable. 
    This proved diffucult and therefore creating a working mobile intergration of the models was not possible. To combat this, I have used my trained models in my website. I would like to intergrate the AI into my application following the submission of DAP as I have thourougly enjoyed exploring
artificial intelligence.</p>
    <img src="" alt="training the AI">
   
    <h3>React Native</h3>
    <p>React Native is a typescript framework that allows for cross-platform development. I have chosen to use React Native because I have understanding of JavaScript and
        the basic concepts of component creation and hooks because of Interactive Media. This seemed like the obvious method to develop an application rather than creating indivdual applications for iOS and
        android respectively. This process was a long period of learning and therefore majority of this semester has consisted of self-learning. The adaptation from web to
        mobile has been a bigger leap than initally anticipated. Regardless of this, I believe that I have managed to produce a satisfactory prototype. 

        Expo has been use for easy deployment in the future and support for distrubuting my application. Expo also allowed me to test the application on my own devices without switching operating systems or having 
        to change my development environment to Android Studio. I initally began development using only the React Native CLI rather than expo because there are more modules and 
        dependacies available in this mode of development yet I found the mix of Java and Typescript alot to handle and I found that I did not require the external dependacies available to non-Expo development.
