 <h2 class="h-entry">Description</h2>
 <hr>
 <p class="e-content"> Hands Up! is a proof of concept application and website that allows users to learn South African sign language in a fun and interactive manner.
    The application aims to use gameification techniques to increase engagement. The lack of resources available to South Africans for learning sign langauge is a massive issue.
    There is currently only one similar application available. My final deliverable explores quizzing to spark motivation for learning which 
    sets Hands Up! apart from other SASL content available online. My final submission includes a proof of concept application available via Expo Snack with navigation functionality, a design document presented as a UX case study and 
    a boilerplate website.
 </p>

 <h2 class="h-entry">Inspiration</h2>
<p>
 This project has had major changes throughout the semester, though a few core inspirations still stand true. I have largely influced by children's book illustration. I enjoy 
 the simplicity and texture of these illustrations and therefore I have used this as a basis for the style of illustration in my site/app. I wanted to set the application apart 
 from the 'corporate art style' by making it feel handmade. </p>


 
 <p class="e-content"> I was also largely inspired by the work of <a href="https://www.hellomonday.com/" target="_blank"> Hello Monday</a>. Hello Monday is a development studio that create incredible 
    artistic tech products. The studio focuses of creative coding and their site <a href="https://fingerspelling.xyz/" target="_blank"> Fingerspelling</a> was a huge inspiration. Fingerspelling users
    Tensorflow's hand pose detection to create a game that teaches American Sign Language. The site uses 3d models that have been stylized to create a beautiful aesthetic for learning.</p>

 <h2 class="h-entry">Goals</h2>
 
 <p class="e-content"> My primary goal of the project was to create a porfolio piece in favour of UX/UI. I relaized that this is a career field that I would like 
    to explore yet have not created what I deem strong case studies to feature on a portfolio. In Interactive Media, we briefly touch on these write-ups but not will full depth. I 
wanted to create a detailed case study that can be directly linked to my portofolio site which I have done.  </p>
<p>My second goal was to push myself in regard to my technical skills. This is a facet of university that has proved to be a weakness of mine. This project allowed me one final 
    opportunity to refine and expand my skillset before approaching the working world. I believe that while the mobile application lacks intergration of AI, I have created an application that 
    clearly expresses the use of learning. I have met my own goal of creating a simple beta application that meets the needs of users. 
</p>
<p>I have explored my want to create illustrations within a technical product. This was conveyed through the use of my own illustrations and even my own custom font. Through my style of illustration I have tried to create a 
    unique aesthetic that reflects my style of drawing in my application. This illustration has also been aimed to be appealing to children. I have attempted to create visual elements that children and adults can be receptive to. 
</p>

<h2 class="h-entry"> Final Reflection</h2>
 <hr>
 <p class="e-content">When embarking on DAP4, I wanted to create a digital product that would tell essential stories about South Africans. Initially, I wanted to make this about my heritage yet this idea changed gradually and resulted in “Hands Up!”. By Crit 2, I realised that I wanted to shift focus to my development and UX/UI skills rather than crafting a story and so I decided to make a bookstore for learning. Based on feedback from lecturers I was encouraged to make my application more interactive in order to promote education. This resulted in the final product idea: Hands Up!

    This reflection will explore the implementation and process of creating Hands Up! Via discussion of central themes such as design and development. 
    
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
 <p class="e-content">I wanted this project to focus on my design skills. I have always considered a career in UX/UI but realized that I have not fully explored this design process. This forced me to better adapt to Figma. I have used Figma in the past for Interactive Media but only for low-fidelity wireframes. This project forced me to explore High Fidelity wireframing and Figma’s prototyping features as well as the process of making mockups. This was incredibly fun and I enjoyed designing and planning my site. I found that the Figma files greatly helped with development because I was able to copy values into my code in order to make my application look good. This was true to certain extent as I struggled to implement all features and styling because of my limited React Native skills. 
</p>
 <p class="e-content">I also created a Case Study for Hands Up! I found this to be an interesting process as I conducted user surveys, competitor research and a deeper analysis of colour theory for the first time. These aspects of UX/UI are an industry standard and I believe that I created an informative case study documentation. This, therefore, fulfils my goals of improving my UX/UI skills in a format that can be used for my portfolio. 

</p>
 <p class="e-content">I also have illustrated all elements. This was an opportunity to showcase my illustration skills as well as UI design. I found that adapting to Adobe Illustrator was difficult and therefore added many hours to my timeline but I finish this project with new illustration skills which allow me to use industry-standard software to create vector illustrations. I did not use vector illustrations purely through the site but I did use them to create my own custom font. This was a late addition to my deliverable and also required further learning since I have never created my own typeface but this felt rewarding in the end. 
</p>
<h3>Developement</h3>
 <p class="e-content">When I was told to seek out gamification techniques in order to reach a younger audience, I came across Machine Learning integration as a solution. This proved a difficult task as I have never worked with ML or mobile development but I wanted to push myself. When choosing this medium, I was aware that my technical skills are not my strongest skill. I have found over the past 4 years that I take a longer time to grasp coding skills than others and I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to enrich my skills. I have always thought of myself as a visual artist first and therefore envisioned my future career being either in the realm of animation or design rather than development, yet this year I have found myself with a deeper interest in development. 
</p>
 <p class="e-content">
    The development process was entirely a self-learning process. Majoring in Interactive Media, I initially expected React Native to have a similar workflow to web development. This was a learning curve. I chose to use the Expo CLI as initial research indicated that Expo allowed for an easier introduction to mobile development. Expo comes with certain restrictions such as the packages supported yet I decided to forgo extra functionality considering this is the first time I have ever used React Native. I found that not using Expo would have made the use of Tensorflow easier but Expo greatly helped with environment set-up and ease of access for marking and deployment.
    </p> 
 <p class="e-content">React Native uses typescript to create cross-platform applications yet there are specific development modes for iOS and Android individually. This proved a problem as I am an iOS user, developing on a Windows device meaning that setting up a development environment to test my application on my own device was not possible. I found that the process of using Android Studio and setting up a custom device emulator seemed tedious. Expo solved this problem as I was then able to test my application on iOS via Expo Go. This helped me get a better feel of the application and the type of experience that the user will feel. I have therefore attached a link to an Expo Snack Bar in order to see my application because markers will be able to use an emulator, test on their own device via downloading Expo Go and scanning the QR Code and see my code in one central place. This seemed like a better solution that GitHub because a repository would require a lot of downloads to see the final product.

</p>
 <p class="e-content">The development process of React Native was also a surprise. I think I am quite used to Vanilla JS and HTML for grasping React Native props and conventions largely slowed down the process. I found that I had to constantly be referring to my previous scripts and documentation to implement simple features because the process is entirely different from web development. The biggest pain I found through this process was the navigation process. In React.js and Vanilla web dev, linking is easy to do yet in React Native, navigation consists of stacking, drawers and modals. The stacking of screens was difficult to grasp as the flow requires careful planning of stacks and drawers/modals to access the content. I am used to simpling linking between pages and not thinking about what should be a modal or drawer instead or if possible. 
    Another surprise was the lack of boilerplate functionality. The process of having to import support of text, scrolling and images was an adjustment. 
    </p> 
 <p class="e-content"> 
    I struggled to implement my Tensorflow models into react native. There has been a recent release of a React Native module for Tensorflow.js which is still largely unused. In order to import models that I trained myself which would be required for Hands Up! As there are no available modals for SASL, I would be required to convert and edit the original Python file manually. This seemed out of scope for the project as I do not know python and learning it in such a short time, and to use it immediately for machine learning seemed unwise. Instead, I integrated my custom training into my website because this integration was much easier. I had to learn P5.js to create a canvas to display the camera but this process was enjoyable and enriching. P5.js aims to make coding more fulfilling for creatives and left me with further inspiration to explore creative code further. This feature compromise for the mobile application seemed justified considering that it resulted in me creating a secondary medium for Hands Up!, and pushing myself to explore ML and AI. 
    
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p class="e-content">Despite my final project not containing all desired functionality to be able to stand alone as a finished application, I believe I have created a strong proof-of-concept application. I have managed to create an application and website with functionality and custom content. Considering this is my first-ever application, I am proud of this and the message behind Hands Up!, which promoted accessibility of communication to the disabled community. The proof of concept application remains as a limited feature preview that can largely be expanded. I believe I have started a project that I would be keen on further in the future and that I have met my goals regarding the project. This includes
    added content and fixing of the AI functionality. This project has also forced me to use a lot of the new information I have gathered in my final year. I do not believe that I would ever consider app development as a skill for me to explore had it not been for Interactive Media and my research Project being AI Art in Africa.
